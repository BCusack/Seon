# Beyond Doomscrolling: The Death of the Smartphone as the Attention Feed

Version: 0.1 (Draft)
Owner: The Seon Core Team

## Abstract
Smartphones have become attention-extraction devices optimised for infinite feeds, intermittent rewards, and personalised persuasion. This paper argues that the smartphone-centric UI paradigm is incompatible with long-term wellbeing and proposes an ear-first, ambient alternative that privileges salience, brevity, consent, and user autonomy. We outline evidence on doomscrolling and attentional harms, and contrast them with the Seon’s design constraints and interaction principles.

## Background: How We Got Here
- Infinite scroll and autoplay exploit variable-ratio reinforcement schedules that drive compulsive use.
- Personalised feeds maximise engagement time and ad exposure, not user outcomes.
- App silos and notification economies create constant, externally-driven context switching.
- Small-screen UX pushes micro-rewards and novelty over reflection and depth.

Cited concerns include increased anxiety, reduced sleep quality, worsened mood, and attentional fragmentation associated with high screen-time and doomscrolling behaviour (evidence base to be expanded with peer-reviewed references).

## Problem Framing: Doomscroll Economics
- Objectives-of-optimisation: engagement minutes and ad conversions vs wellbeing.
- Friction-free loops: swipe/scroll/tap cycles with zero natural stop cues.
- Social validation pipelines: likes/streaks/alerts amplifying compulsion.
- Cognitive load: context-switch debt and attentional residue impairing task performance.

## Design Stance: Ear-first, Ambient, Bounded
The Seon rejects the endless feed. Interaction is designed to be:
- Low-friction but bounded: short, time-limited exchanges by default (e.g., 15–60 seconds).
- Salience-triggered: interactions initiated by meaningful context (schedule, location, biometrics) rather than idle novelty.
- Private-by-default: on-device processing where possible; minimal retention.
- Consent-forward: explicit consent for sensitive sensing and memory promotion; per-channel controls.
- No infinite feeds: the Seon provides answers, nudges, or summaries—not feeds.

## Principles and Guardrails
- Time caps: session timers and daily attention budgets with opt-in overrides.
- No streaks, no variable-ratio rewards: avoid slot-machine patterns by design.
- Usefulness over engagement: optimise for outcomes (completed task, felt support) not minutes used.
- Reflective surfaces: brief day summaries, clear next actions, and opt-in wellbeing check-ins.
- Silence by default: no speculative notifications; alerts only when salience thresholds are met.

## Interaction Patterns (Examples)
- Micro-briefings: 30-second summary of today’s key events when you put on your ear-clip.
- Contextual nudges: “You have 10 minutes before your call—want the 1‑minute prep?”
- Emotional check-ins: “You’ve sounded stressed the last few conversations—want a breathing exercise?”
- Anti-doomscroll alternative: “Want a 2‑minute world update? Headlines only, deeper reads saved to your later list.”

## Technical Implications
- Ephemeral context buffer with salience-based promotion to long-term memory.
- Graph-structured memory to relate people, events, tasks, and wellbeing signals.
- Policy guardrails to suppress non-salient, feed-like behaviours.
- Local-first architectures and device mesh for privacy and latency.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Over-prompting fatigue → adaptive throttling and user-tuned sensitivity.
- Over-reliance → promote skill-building and autonomy; encourage human contact.
- Privacy → transparent logs, opt-in data scopes, and hard data minimisation.

## Related Work (to expand)
- Attention economy critiques; digital wellbeing research; persuasive design ethics.
- Alternatives: wearables, glanceable UIs, e‑ink companions, smart speakers.

## Conclusion
The doomscrolling era is a design failure, not a user failure. Moving beyond smartphone-centric, feed-driven UX requires intentional constraints and ambient, context-aware companions. The Seon’s ear-first, bounded, and consent-forward approach offers a viable path toward humane, outcome-focused everyday AI.
