# Beyond Doomscrolling: Boredom, Thought Trains, and a Kinder Companion (TED‑style)

## Talk

What if the problem isn’t our attention span?
What if it’s our relationship with boredom—and the trains of thought that follow?

When boredom taps us on the shoulder, we reach for a tiny rectangle.
Not because there’s something vital inside it, but because it promises escape.
One swipe, one scroll, one more micro‑hit.

Here’s the uncomfortable question: who benefits when we’re bored?
Because the status quo does. Engagement is a business model, not a virtue.
The more we idle, the more we scroll. The more we scroll, the more we ruminate.

Yes—rumination. Not just news, not just feeds. Thought loops.
“I should be doing more.”
“Why did I say that?”
“Everyone else looks happier.”

We don’t doomscroll only for novelty. We do it to outrun these loops.
And like running on a treadmill, we end exactly where we began—only more tired.

So let’s question the device we made into a compass.
If a tool’s default is infinite, is it still a tool—or a tunnel?
If every gap in our day becomes a portal to somewhere else, where do we actually live?

Now imagine something different.
Not a screen. Not a feed.
An ear‑first companion that meets you in the moment, then gets out of the way.

A companion that treats boredom as a signal, not an enemy.
That asks, gently: “Is this a moment to breathe, to act, or to be?”

That companion is the Seon.

Here’s how it behaves—by design:

- It’s bounded. Conversations take seconds, not sessions. There is no rabbit hole.
- It is salience‑led. It notices context—your calendar, your energy, your environment—and only speaks when it matters.
- It motivates. Tiny, timely nudges help you re‑enter life: “Two minutes before your call—want the one‑minute prep?”
- It interrupts negative thought trains with care. “You sound a bit stuck—would a quick reframing help, or shall I be quiet with you?”
- It respects consent and quiet. Silence is the default. You decide what’s remembered.

This is not productivity cosplay. It is humane design.
We optimise for outcomes you can feel: a task finished, a mood lifted, a breath taken, a friend called.
Not minutes in‑app.

Some examples:

- The Boredom Pivot: “You’ve checked your phone three times in two minutes. Fancy a 30‑second reset or a tiny win?”
- Micro‑Momentum: “One small step towards your draft? I’ll time two focused minutes.”
- Compassionate Interrupt: “I’m hearing self‑criticism. Would you like a kinder reframe or a grounding exercise?”
- World in a Teacup: “Want headlines only—90 seconds, no scroll? I’ll save deep dives for later.”

Under the hood, the Seon keeps your world in a light, privacy‑first memory—people, commitments, signals—so it can be relevant without being clingy.
It links what matters (Jill ↔ Bob ↔ hospital appointment) and lets the rest fade.
No infinite feeds. No slot‑machine rewards. No streaks.

Boredom doesn’t have to be a void we fear.
It can be a doorway—into presence, into action, into rest.
When the moment calls for motivation, the Seon offers momentum.
When the mind spirals, it offers a gentle hand on the brake.

And when nothing is needed, it offers nothing at all.

What if our technology measured its success not in how long it holds us,
but in how gracefully it lets us go?

That’s the future we’re building towards: fewer tunnels, more doorways.
Less rumination, more life.

The Seon—ear‑first, bounded, consent‑forward—asks for your attention only when it can give you something better back.

Thank you.

Notes for expansion (outside the talk):
- Safeguards: time caps, opt‑in wellbeing prompts, transparent logs, local‑first processing.
- Interaction policy: no infinite feeds, no variable‑ratio rewards, salience thresholds for notifications.
- Research links to add: boredom and creativity; rumination and mental health; humane design and persuasive tech ethics.
