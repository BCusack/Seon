## Discovery

### Overview
In investigating solutions for the problem of prototyping the memory manaagement system for the Seon, we evaluated several technologies and approaches. The goal was to find a method that could effectively manage and query resources in a distributed system, while also being user-friendly and efficient.

### Technologies and Approaches evaluated
1. **Letta** - A tool designed to help users discover and manage resources in a distributed system. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching and filtering resources, as well as managing their lifecycle.
2. **Langraph with pgAI** - A combination of Langraph, a graph database, and pgAI, a PostgreSQL extension for AI capabilities. This approach allows for efficient querying and management of resources using graph-based relationships.
3. **Knowledge Graphs** - A method of representing resources and their relationships in a graph format, enabling complex queries and insights into resource connections.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **User-Friendliness**: The solution should be easy to use and understand for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Efficiency**: The system should be able to handle large volumes of data and queries without significant performance degradation.
- **Scalability**: The solution should be able to scale with the growth of the system and the number of resources.
- **Flexibility**: The system should allow for easy modifications and additions to the resource management capabilities.
- **Integration**: The solution should be able to integrate with existing systems and technologies used in the project.
- **Cost**: The solution should be cost-effective, considering both initial setup and ongoing maintenance costs.

## Letta 
### Overview
Letta is a tool designed to help users discover and manage resources in a distributed system. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching and filtering resources, as well as managing their lifecycle.

### Pros
- **Backend server**: Letta provides a backend server that can be used to manage resources and their lifecycle.
- **Memory extensable**: The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy modifications and additions to the resource management capabilities.
- **Open source**: Letta is open source, which allows for community contributions and improvements.
- **Self hosted**: The tool can be self-hosted, providing control over the data and system.
- **Tool integartion**: Letta can be integrated with other tools and technologies such as MCP, allowing for a more comprehensive resource management solution.

### Cons
- **Limited querying capabilities**: Letta's querying capabilities are not as advanced as some other solutions, which may limit its effectiveness for complex resource management tasks.
- **Performance**: The performance of Letta may not be optimal for very large datasets or complex queries, which could lead to slower response times.
- **Still feels under development**: As an open-source project, Letta may still be in active development, which could lead to potential bugs or instability in the system. Some MCP features fail to work as expected.
