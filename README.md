## Why I created this research space
Sometimes I get a brain tick, an idea that needs to be explored. This is one of those ideas. I wanted to explore the concept of AI companionship and how it could evolve in the future. This is a living document that will evolve as the project evolves.

I chose GitHub as the platform for this research as it is a great place to collaborate and share ideas.
